1. Create an XML document with customer data yourself. Let each customer have 2-3 attributes
2. Write a SAX parser that will output customer data to the console, and also output a message (any) to the console when document processing began and when document processing was completed
3. Write a DOM parser to output all customer data to the console
4. Let both of these parsers be inherited from one interface. Let the interface have one method and parser classes implement it
